Hey there! Here is my story. 
Once there was a man.
He was walking on the street, and then he saw a grocery shop.

In the grocery shop window, he saw that they had the ingredient he was 
missing and had been looking for.  He decided to enter the store, and 
discovered something he had not expected

He found that almost every person in that shop turned into zombie and tried to bite each other. He was shocked and did not know what to do next.*The end*
